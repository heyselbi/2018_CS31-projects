a. A brief description of notable obstacles you overcame.

My biggest struggle was structuring my plan of attack overall. As mentioned in FAQs, I really did not know where to begin. Biggest obstacle was I was not sure how to get state forecasts separately. Initially, I looked for commas and scanned chars before the comma for mistakes. But that quickly got way too complicated because of too many rules. Then I took a day off to think about it, and remembered we can save chars as we scan through. Once I figured that out, rest was easy.
I also was not sure how to go about conversion of strings to integers that can be summed up. But after reading lecture notes, I figured they can be done via char conversion. I wondered if there is an easier way of converting strings into integers, besides writing a switch code for converison.


b. A description of the design of your program

==> In bool hasProperSyntax(string pollData) I first check the overall syntax.
...
repeatedly:
	check for blanks in poll data
	capitalize all letters so it is easier to work with and is consistent
..

==> Then slice out the forecasts and analyze them character by character
...
repeatedly:
	save chars from poll data until you bump into comma
	once comma is found, your state forecast is ready to be analyzed
		check state code is correct
		if no forecasts exist for state, skip it
		if forecasts do exist for state, analyze it
			check that there are no other letters after state code, but should be a digit
			repeatedly:
				look for the party code in state forecast
				check that there is a digit before and after party code (for all party codes except the last one in state forecast)
				check that there are no other chars but letters and digits in overall forecast
			for last party code that was not checked above:
				check that it is at the end of the state forecast
				check that it has a digit and not letter before it
	if all above test passed successfully, report the syntax correct.
....

==> In int tallySeats(string pollData, char party, int& seatTally) I first check the proper syntax, then tally the number of votes
	check if poll data has proper syntax
	check is party code is correct (ie. a letter)
	capitalize all letters in party code and poll data so it is easier to work with and is consistent
	repeatedly:
		save chars from poll data until you bump into comma
		once comma is found, your state forecast is ready to be analyzed
		for states that have forecasts:
			find the party code and record its tally
			convert tally number in string type to char type
			convert chars to integers
			sum up integers in proper way to get the same tally
			sum up all tallies for the party
	report the sum and return 0
..

c. A list of the test data that could be used to thoroughly test your program, along with the reason for each test.

==> Errors in pollData syntax. There is/are...

- incorrect stateCode: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D,XZ34I56D", 'D', s); --> XZ is not a state code 
- empty space: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D, NY34I56D", 'D', s); --> space between , and N
- character that is not a digit or alphabetic: int r = tallySeats("NC12R-01D,NY34I56D", 'D', s); --> "-" between R and 0
- no digit after stateCode: int r = tallySeats("NCR01D,NY34I56D", 'D', s); --> There should be a tally number between NC and R, even it is 0
- two commas consecutive: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D,,NY34I56D", 'D', s); --> ,, not allowed
- a comma at the end: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D,NY34I56D,", 'D', s); --> there should be no "," after D
- more than one letter for partyCode: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D,NY34IN56D", 'D', s); --> ..IN.. has to be just I. It will also catch if no digit before party letter

- States with no forecasts are read correctly: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D,VT,NY34I56D", 'D', s); --> this has correct syntax even if VT has no forecasts
- PollData that is empty is read correctly: int r = tallySeats("", 'D', s) --> no syntax error and returns 0 for r and 0 for s


==> Errors in summing up tallies.

- tallying all up even if state forecast reported R votes twice: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D15R,NY34I56D", 'R', s) --> NC has (12+15) R votes, not just 12
- tallies up correctly across state forecasts: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D,NY34I56D,NH6R,CT7D", 'D', s) --> tally is (1+56+7) = 64
- incorrect pollData syntax returns 1: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D,XZ34I56D", 'D', s) --> incorrect syntax of pollData (ie. state code is wrong)
- incorrect party code syntax returns 2: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D,NY34I56D", '2', s) --> party code should be an alphabetic character
- party code is not a character at all: int r = tallySeats("NC12R01D,NY34I56D", "D", s) --> should give error because D is a string here
- any non-capital letters are recognized fine: int r = tallySeats("nC12r01D,Vt,Ny34I56d", 'd', s) --> should give true for both the poll data and party code and tally
- works with one or 50 digits for vote count: int r = tallySeats("nC120r1D,Vt,Ny34I567d", 'd', s) --> total sum is (1+567) = 568

**All tests were checked and passed.

The only one I am not sure is even correct assumption to make, is when it tallies and finds a syntax error, should it or should it not calculate and reassign the seatTally?
