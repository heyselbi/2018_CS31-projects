I do not have the full project descriptions

Please do not copy the solutions but rather could use this as a guide/help. The main purpose of this is to store/backup my projects. Prof. Smallberg and the team has developed thorough screening techniques that detect any part of the code in the assignment that has been copied. He is also aware of these solutions posted on Github.
